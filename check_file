# File Existence Check and Listing

# This script checks if a file exists and, if so, lists its details using 'ls -l'.
# If the file does not exist, it prints an error message and exits with a non-zero status.

# 🛠️ Usage:
# Make sure the script has executable permissions. Run it using ./script_name.sh <file_path>

if test ! -e $1
then
   echo "$1 does not exist."
   exit 1
else
   ls -l $1
fi

# Count the number of executable files in the current working directory

# This script counts the number of executable files in the current working directory.
# It iterates through each file in the directory using a 'for' loop.
# For each file, it checks if the file is executable using the 'test' command with the '-x' option.
# If the file is executable, it increments the count and lists details of the file using 'ls -l'.
# Finally, it prints the total number of executable files found.

# üõ†Ô∏è Usage:
# Make sure the script has executable permissions. Run it using ./script_name.sh

do
   if test -x $i
   then
      count=`expr $count + 1`
      ls -l $i
   fi
done

echo "There are $count executable files."
